    <h3>Weight Lifting</h3>
    <img src="https://tinyurl.com/4b5nmya5" height="150px">
    <p> Weight lifting is an easy way to relieve stress after a workday and helps me work on myself. I started lifting as a way to better my body and lifestyle and continue to do so until I achieve my goals and create new ones to always improve and hopefully motivate others to do the same in the fitness space.</p>

    <h3>Gaming</h3>

    <p>Gaming is something I've tried to cut back on to focus on advancing my career, but it's always something I've enjoyed doing and something I'll always find time for. It's an escape from the real world for a little bit and helps creativity flow while easing the stresses of life. </p>

    <h3>Fashion</h3>

    <p>Fashion is something I recently got into, specifically sneakers. I'm loving the aspect of styling yourself to show what kind of person you're into and the challenge of bringing something unique to an outfit, but not being too outlandish with the idea.  </p>
