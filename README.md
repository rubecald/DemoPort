## This personal website was fun to do, although I'm not too creative when it comes to designing stuff. I tried to add some flare to my basic website, but I realized there's still a lot to learn for me in terms of building a website that a user would enjoy navigating and looking at.

## The about page was probably the most fun and what I took the most time on, as my Portfolio page was just filling in the blanks from the About page

## My portfolio page is of projects I've seen on Reddit that are deemed(in order) easy, medium and hard level projects. I do aspire to get to the level it takes to create those projects and hopefully put them in my resume in the future.
