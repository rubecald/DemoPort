        <h3>Calculator</h3>
        <img src="https://tinyurl.com/5xn54xj9" height="250px">
        <p> I hope to start with a simple calculator app once I've learned how to code properly in Javascript, mainly to prove to myself that I can create a working program on my own with my own skills.</p>
        <h3>Quizzing</h3>
        <img class="right"  src="https://tinyurl.com/5n8pn9ma " height="100px">
        <p>An app that can quiz me can help me in two ways: <ul>
            <li> Gauge my progress by helping me see what concepts I've retained and which ones I need help on </li>
            <li> Show myself the progress I've made by creating a somewhat difficult app with what I've learned.</li>
        </ul></p> 
        <h3>Online Shop</h3>
        <img class="fashion" src="https://tinyurl.com/4c5dbccr" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>An online shop(maybe similar to Ebay or Amazon) would be the best way to show I fully understand Javascript and show prospective employers that I definitely know what I'm doing and that I can actually create apps/websites that are functional and useful to the common person.</p>
